Description: Highly efficient functions for estimating various rank (centrality) measures of nodes in bipartite graphs (two-mode networks) including HITS, CoHITS, BGRM, and Birank. Also provides easy-to-use tools for incorporating or removing edge-weights during rank estimation, projecting two-mode graphs to one-mode, efficiently estimating PageRank in one-mode graphs, and for converting edgelists and matrices to sparse matrix format. Best of all, the package's rank estimators can work directly with common formats of network data, including edgelists (class data.frame, data.table, and tbl_df) and adjcency matrices (class matrix and dgCMatrix).
